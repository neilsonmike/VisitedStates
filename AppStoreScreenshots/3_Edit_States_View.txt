EDIT STATES VIEW SCREENSHOT

Caption: "Easy Customization"

Content:
- iPhone 13 Pro mockup frame
- Edit States view showing the alphabetical list of all US states
- Several states should have checkmarks indicating they've been visited
- Some state names should appear in bold to indicate GPS detection
- "Edit States" should appear at the top as the screen title
- "Done" button visible in the top left
- Text at top under the title: "States in bold were detected by GPS"

Screenshot should be taken with the following specifications:
- 1290 x 2796 pixels for iPhone 14 Pro Max
- 1179 x 2556 pixels for iPhone 14 Pro
- 1284 x 2778 pixels for iPhone 13 Pro Max
- 1170 x 2532 pixels for iPhone 13 Pro

Design notes:
- Show enough states to demonstrate the list functionality (at least 15-20 states)
- Make sure the bold states (GPS detected) are clearly distinguishable
- The checkmarks should be in the app's accent color (blue)
- This screenshot demonstrates how users can manually edit their visited states
