SHARE PREVIEW SCREENSHOT

Caption: "Share Your Journey"

Content:
- iPhone 13 Pro mockup frame
- Share Preview view showing a formatted image ready to be shared
- The preview should contain:
  * The VisitedStates logo at the top
  * A map of the United States with several states highlighted
  * Text showing the number of states visited (e.g., "32/50 States Visited")
- iOS share sheet partially visible at the bottom showing sharing options
- "Share" should appear at the top as the screen title

Screenshot should be taken with the following specifications:
- 1290 x 2796 pixels for iPhone 14 Pro Max
- 1179 x 2556 pixels for iPhone 14 Pro
- 1284 x 2778 pixels for iPhone 13 Pro Max
- 1170 x 2532 pixels for iPhone 13 Pro

Design notes:
- Make sure the share preview is the focal point and looks high-quality
- The map colors should match those from previous screenshots for consistency
- Include enough of the share sheet to show that sharing is possible
- This screenshot demonstrates the social sharing functionality of the app
- The preview should look polished and ready to be posted on social media
