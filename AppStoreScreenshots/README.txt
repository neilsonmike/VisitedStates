## Screenshot Checklist

The App Store requires a minimum of one screenshot per device size, but it's recommended to provide all five to showcase your app's features:

1. Main Map View - "Track Your Travels"
2. Alaska & Hawaii View - "All 50 States"
3. Edit States View - "Easy Customization"
4. Settings View - "Personalize Your Map"
5. Share Preview - "Share Your Journey"

## Captions

Keep captions short, compelling, and focused on the key feature being shown. Captions should be:
- 1-5 words in length
- Visually prominent but not overwhelming
- Consistent in style across all screenshots
- Placed in the same position across all screenshots

## Additional Tips

- Use a consistent color theme across all screenshots
- Ensure text is readable on all device sizes
- Use real data that looks plausible (e.g., states that form a logical travel pattern)
- Test screenshots at different sizes to ensure clarity
- Consider device frames for a more professional look
