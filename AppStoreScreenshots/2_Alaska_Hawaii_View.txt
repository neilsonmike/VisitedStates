Caption: "All 50 States"

Content:
- iPhone 13 Pro mockup frame
- Main map showing continental US states
- Alaska and Hawaii shown as insets in the bottom left corner
- All three regions (continental, Alaska, Hawaii) should have some highlighted states
- Text at top showing "32/50 States Visited"

Screenshot should be taken with the following specifications:
- 1290 x 2796 pixels for iPhone 14 Pro Max
- 1179 x 2556 pixels for iPhone 14 Pro
- 1284 x 2778 pixels for iPhone 13 Pro Max

Design notes:
- Make sure Alaska and Hawaii insets are clearly visible
- Use the same color scheme for all three regions
- Ensure the insets don't look too small or hard to see
- This screenshot demonstrates the app's ability to handle all US states, not just the continental ones
